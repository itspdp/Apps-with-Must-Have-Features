# Apps-with-Must-Have-Features (Still Writing- Beta)
There are Hundreds of our daily use apps, And Variety and Options in a Single category. But As I think many of your might also have felt that not each app is perfect in itslef. And Therefore we have to use two different notes or Gallery app Just for the sake of 1-2 Features that lacks in others.
So That we Dont Have to Carry Two Different Apps.
So Here I'm Listing Some Must to Have Features in a Common category of Apps.
I also want you to contribute what you like or want as a must to have feature in Your favorite App, within a category.
Thank You
